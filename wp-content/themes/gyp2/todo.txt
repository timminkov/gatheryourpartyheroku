OFFICIAL todo list

NEEDED FOR SITE TO BE CONSIDERED FINISHED

 * Make youtube embeds responsive
 * Name of page on search results\tag query
 * Refactor loop code! Right now there's some copy-pasting going on
 * Thumbnails should be grabbed at a higher res when using the mobile view (future proof suggestion: the <picture> element and picturefill.js) or display smaller thumbs
 * 'How to post on GYP2 video' without editor bugs
 * Social buttons on articles? Everyone loves those

OPTIONAL IF WE HAVE TIME, OR POST-LAUNCH

 Featured articles on main page
 Bigger view (>920px)
 Popular articles display in sidebar
 Show series (e.g. podcasts->gypodcasts,gdv,gyperspective) in sidebar when appropriate
 Allow admins\editors to change cover photo on index page
 Better meta info than tags for reviews
 Slideshows in posts
 Refactoring of incredibly shitty code (note: this will never happen)
 RPG-like stats for users on about page
 Let contributors edit their posts (is this even a good idea?)
 Custom fonts for titles

 I apologize for my incomprehensible css

FINISHED


Complete index page with responsive view
Single.php except comments and responsive view
Possibly go back to singles.php, make the featured image more like http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/09/05/divekick-review (top area expands vertically)
'Contribute to GYP' page with email option and http://wordpress.org/plugins/user-submitted-posts/
Search form and pagination
Stream page
Mediaeelement.js on podcasts + custom fields
Author bios page
WP menus on responsive nav
Display media type by tag on front page
Image captions
Bugfix: custom styles only appear in the dropdown SOME of the time. Cause totally unknown. Edit: might be fixed in latest wordpress, as I have not run into this for a while.
Custom fields for youtube embeds (this is proving tricky because ideally i'd like the video to appear in the cover-image section, but I didn't write the html with that in mind)
Comments section
Responsive view for single.php (note: this is proving tricky because me.js will ONLY do fixed-width at ONE SINGULAR WIDTH FOR THE WHOLE SITE)
Search results page\tag results page (do this LAST)
Fix header at very low resolutions\very narrow screens (I think another breakpoint that makes the text smaller and shunts the title below the cover image is needed)
Favicon?
