      <h3>Preface</h3>
      <p>Gather Your Party was created for two main reasons: The first was to make sure we as an "audience" had some kind of voice in a world that was dominated by casual reviewers and paid off journalists. The second was simply to have a good creative outlet.</p>

      <p>The first can obviously only be accomplished if we mirror the professionalism exhibited by those sites at face value. This means that we should act like we are a working, functional company. Keeping up appearances is important at Gather Your Party. This means:</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>Do not repost internal workings (including site stats, voting, inner-workings) on boards, emails, etc.</li>
        <li>Do not treat Gather Your Party as your own personal blog. If your post isn't in any way entertaining or informative, it shouldn't be on this site. Try to aim for quality over quantity.</li>
        <li>Do not post non-gaming related things to Gather Your Party. I cannot stress this enough - We are a video gaming site that focuses on playing video games. No, Wreck It Ralph or Smash-It-Steve is not video games. Just remember to differentiate whether something is about video games or video game culture.</li>
        <li>Do not be a sensationalist asshole. Rob said it best:
          <blockquote>
            The reason Kotaku is bad journalism is because:<br />
            A) They report things that happened ages ago<br />
            B) They report things that are nothing to do with games<br />
            C) They write troll articles to bait for hits and try to start shitstorms about discrimination<br />
            D) They aren't critical enough of the games they cover/review<br />
          </blockquote>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Here are a few things that are not okay:</p>
      <blockquote>"Hey /v/, just got recruited by Gather Your Party. Had to go through an entire process where they voted on me in the forums and then discussed me in their Mumble!"</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"I just got an account from Gather Your Party! If you guys send me stuff I'll post it up."</blockquote>

      <h3>I've been accepted as a contributor to Gather Your Party! What now?</h3>
      <p>The first thing to make sure you're "in" to the contributor community. Join the Mumble and the Steam Group.</p>
      <p>The next thing you're going to want to do is probably browse the forums to get a general "feel" of things. Read the idea forum, read the general forum, read the editing forum, etc. Talk to some members, introduce yourself, see how GYP actually works from the back-end.</p>
      <h3>What should I write/talk about? What CAN I write/talk about?</h3>
      <p>If you're a writer, avoid making blog style posts of nonsense. Our readers don't want to hear how your day is going - Please only make posts directly relevant to video games. Talk about a game you like. Talk ludology. If you're stuck for inspiration, why not ask around for an interview? Remember, you're at a proper gaming outlet now - we've gotten interviews from Richard Garriot, American McGee, Austin Winroy, Grant Kirkhope and more - just ask nicely! (and make sure they tweet the link...)</p>
      <p>As far as reviews go, please review newer games only (as in released within the last month). If you're looking to review older games, you can create a regular column with some kind of "twist".</p>
      <h3>I want to review X game</h3>
      <p>Make sure you notify everyone that you're going to review it on the idea reservation forum - We have had several incidents where this didn't happen and multiple people reviewed the same game. Feelings were hurt. Friendships were forged. The face of the world was chan-</p>
      <p>Sorry. I got a bit carried away.</p>
      <h3>How does all this copyright nonsense work?</h3>
      <p>Your content is your own. If you ever want something removed from the site, please feel free to message me on here, steam, or by email. That being said, content created for the site should be tagged for the site somehow. Comics should have the site logo and a link to the site, videos should have the site intro. Try not to plug your blog/twitter/facebook on your posts - It's bad form.</p>
      <p>If you want to monetize your own videos on your channel, go for it. Keep in mind that all videos posted to Gather Your Party should be tagged with the GYP intro.</p>
      <h3>I make videos for GYP, where do I get that stupid intro?</h3>
      <p><a href="http://gatheryourparty.com/video/gypanim1.mp4">Here.</a></p>
      <p>Alternatively you can create your own intro, but please be aware it should be plainly visible - Do not just stamp the site logo somewhere where it's difficult to see. The first 3-4 seconds should be dedicated to Gather Your Party.</p>
      <h3>Reading is for nerds! Let's get to posting!</h3>
      <p>Whoa, hold up there partner! Until you get into the swing of things, you may want to consider posting your stuff to the editing forum, so that another GYP contributor can take a look at it. If your article sucks we will not post it to the site, but we'd be very happy to give you some honest feedback and help you improve it.</p>
      <p>If you don't want to bother an editor, a handy set of automatic proofreading tools is available under Users>Your Profile. It'll add an option to the 'edit\add post' view to automatically check your work for spelling\grammar errors, cliches, awkward sentences, etc.</p>
      <h3>Posting to Wordpress</h3>
      <h4>General</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Once something is ready to be published, please submit it for review.</li>

        <li>Make sure anything you submit has been edited and is free of grammatical errors.</li>
        <li>Items missing featured images, excerpts, or have other glaring issues will be spit back at you and remarked as a draft.</li>
        <li>Titles should in general be capitalized. "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog"</li>
        <li>It's advised that you fill out all the SEO information - our number one source of traffic is Google, so anything that increases our search engine visibility helps us a lot.</li>
